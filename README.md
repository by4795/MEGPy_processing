# TGLF NN GyroKit input pipeline
This repo contains examples of how to setup TGLF runs with GyroKit and MEGPy.

# Contents
- ./data/ contains both a EX2GK pickle data file and the corresponding core_profiles and equilibrium IDS files.
- ./notebooks/ contains iPython notebooks that show how to extract MEGPy geometry coefficients and how to process the EX2GK profiles into TGLF runs with GyroKit.
- ./tglf_run.py is a full run script that can perform runs from a database of files, for now it for-loops over 2 radial locations in the 1 example case.
